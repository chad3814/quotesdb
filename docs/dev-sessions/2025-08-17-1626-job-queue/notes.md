# Job Queue Development Session Notes

## Session Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive job queue system for the QuotesDB application. The system provides asynchronous task processing with automatic retries, timeout handling, and distributed job execution.

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Phases (1-10):

1. **Database Foundation** 
   - Added Job model to Prisma schema with JobType enum
   - Configured indexes for efficient querying
   - Applied database migrations

2. **Core Job Service** 
   - Created jobService.ts with atomic job operations
   - Implemented job claiming with transaction support
   - Added completion handling with exponential backoff retry logic

3. **Coordinator Service Setup** 
   - Built Express server with graceful shutdown
   - Added health check endpoint
   - Configured environment variables

4. **Job Management API** 
   - POST /jobs - Create new jobs
   - GET /jobs/:id - Get job status
   - DELETE /jobs/:id - Cancel jobs

5. **Runner Operations API** 
   - POST /jobs/claim - Atomic job claiming
   - POST /jobs/:id/complete - Report job results

6. **Timeout Monitor** 
   - Background process checking for timed-out jobs
   - Automatic retry scheduling
   - Integration with coordinator lifecycle

7. **Retry Logic** 
   - Exponential backoff with jitter (4-8s base, doubling, max 1 hour)
   - Max 10 retry attempts
   - Respect retry delays in job claiming

8. **Logging Infrastructure** 
   - Structured JSON logging with Winston
   - Event-specific log helpers
   - Comprehensive logging throughout system

9. **Example Runner** 
   - Polling-based job processor
   - Handles TMDB_SYNC and BATCH_QUOTE_PROCESS job types
   - Simulated work with occasional failures for testing

10. **Testing & Documentation**  
    - Unit and integration tests deferred for future session
    - Development scripts added to package.json

### Not Implemented (Phase 11):

11. **Production Readiness**
    - Docker containerization
    - Kubernetes/deployment configuration
    - These require additional infrastructure setup

## Key Decisions

1. **Single Table Design**: Chose single jobs table over separate tables for different states to simplify queries and state transitions.

2. **REST over gRPC/MQ**: Used REST API for simplicity and ease of debugging, can migrate to more efficient protocols later if needed.

3. **Timeout at 1.25x**: Provides buffer for network delays while still detecting stuck jobs promptly.

4. **Logging over Metrics**: Started with comprehensive logging; metrics endpoints can be added when monitoring infrastructure is ready.

## Development Scripts

- `npm run coordinator:dev` - Run coordinator in development with hot reload
- `npm run coordinator:build` - Build coordinator for production
- `npm run coordinator:start` - Run built coordinator
- `npm run runner:example` - Run example runner

## Testing the System

1. Start the coordinator:
   ```bash
   npm run coordinator:dev
   ```

2. In another terminal, run the example runner:
   ```bash
   npm run runner:example
   ```

3. Create a test job:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/jobs \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"type": "TMDB_SYNC", "arguments": {"movieId": 123}}'
   ```

4. Check job status:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/jobs/{job-id}
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Production Deployment**: Create Docker images and Kubernetes manifests
3. **Monitoring**: Add metrics endpoints and dashboards
4. **Job Types**: Implement actual TMDB sync and batch quote processing logic
5. **Dead Letter Queue**: Add permanent failure handling
6. **Job Dependencies**: Support for job chains and DAGs

## Technical Debt

- Tests are not implemented yet (deferred to focus on core functionality)
- Production deployment configuration needs GitOps integration
- Error handling could be more granular with custom error types
- Consider adding job priority levels in the future

## Lessons Learned

- Prisma transactions work well for atomic job claiming
- Winston provides good structured logging out of the box
- Express middleware pattern works well for shutdown handling
- Exponential backoff with jitter prevents thundering herd on retries
