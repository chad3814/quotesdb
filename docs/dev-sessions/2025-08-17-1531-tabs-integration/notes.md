# Session Notes

## Progress Summary

Successfully implemented Phase 2 of the Tabstack integration:

### Completed Tasks

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added `imdbQuoteId` field to Quote model (nullable, unique)
   - Added `FETCH_IMDB_QUOTES` to JobType enum
   - Pushed schema changes to database

2. **Tabstack API Integration**
   - Created `src/lib/tabstack.ts` - API client for fetching IMDb quotes
   - Implements schema-based web scraping via Tabstack API
   - Handles 404s and empty results gracefully

3. **Quote Parsing Logic**
   - Created `src/lib/imdbQuoteParser.ts` - parses raw IMDb data
   - Correctly identifies dialogue, stage directions, and narration
   - Normalizes character names and quote text

4. **Job Runner Implementation**
   - Created `src/runners/fetchImdbQuotesRunner.ts` - job handler logic
   - Created `src/runners/imdbQuoteRunner.ts` - runner service
   - Handles duplicate detection and manual quote preservation
   - Returns detailed statistics (quotes imported, characters created, etc.)

5. **Movie Creation Hook**
   - Modified `src/lib/tmdb.ts` to queue jobs when movies with IMDb IDs are added
   - Non-blocking job queue (movie creation succeeds even if queue fails)

6. **NPM Scripts**
   - Added `npm run runner:imdb` to start the IMDb quote runner

## Testing Plan

To test the end-to-end flow:

1. **Start the services:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Coordinator (already running)
   npm run coordinator:dev
   
   # Terminal 2: IMDb Quote Runner
   npm run runner:imdb
   
   # Terminal 3: Main app (if not running)
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Add a movie with quotes on IMDb:**
   - Go to `/movies/add`
   - Search for a movie known to have quotes (e.g., "The Godfather", "Star Wars")
   - Add the movie
   - Check logs to see job queued

3. **Monitor the job processing:**
   - Watch coordinator logs for job claim
   - Watch runner logs for quote fetching
   - Check database for imported quotes

4. **Verify results:**
   - Use Prisma Studio (`npm run db:studio`) to check:
     - Quote records with `imdbQuoteId` populated
     - QuoteLine records with proper character attribution
     - New Character records created as needed

## Known Limitations

- Tabstack API requires `TABSTACK_TOKEN` environment variable
- Rate limiting not implemented (relies on job queue retry mechanism)
- Character-actor linking not implemented (characters created without actor association)
- No admin UI yet for monitoring job queue

## Implementation Status

âœ… **Phase 2 Complete with Fixes Applied**:

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Environment Variable**: Moved TABSTACK_TOKEN from `.env.local` to `.env`
2. **API Schema Format**: Updated to use proper JSON Schema with:
   - `additionalProperties: false` on all objects
   - `required` arrays listing all properties
   - Simplified schema for basic quote extraction
3. **Quote Parser**: Updated to parse raw text with character attribution
- Database schema updated
- Tabstack API client created
- Quote parsing logic implemented
- Job runner created and running
- Movie creation hook integrated
- All code passing TypeScript and lint checks

## Services Running
- Coordinator: `npm run coordinator:dev` (bash_9)
- IMDb Runner: `npm run runner:imdb` (bash_10)
- Database Studio: `npm run db:studio` (bash_1)

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

- Create admin interface for job queue monitoring
- Add bulk queue operations for existing movies
- Display job statistics and completion rates

## Testing Instructions

To test the implementation:
1. Ensure `TABSTACK_TOKEN` is set in `.env`
2. Go to `/movies/add` in the web app
3. Add a movie that has quotes on IMDb (e.g., "The Godfather", "Star Wars")
4. Monitor the runner logs to see quote fetching
5. Check Prisma Studio for imported quotes
